## Welcome to the Apocalypse

Even magic, they say, has rules that should not be broken. Yet, in a mystical land, a wizard with an unlimited thirst for power, crossed the threshold that Gods themselves had not dared by casting an impossible *10th level spell*. It shattered the dimensions. Humans from faraway lands, with vast powers of “technology”, crashed through the portals with tanks, aircraft, robots, and fatty, processed, packaged foods.

War erupted. When the dust settled, magic, machinery, and everything in between lay muddled. Great cities were laid to waste. The few that survive, do what they can to find food, shelter, and rebuild the remains of civilization.

**Goblins & Grappling Hooks** is a traditional tabletop roleplaying game, set in an atomic wasteland where humanoids, machines, and awakened plants roam an irradiated planet trying to survive, keep the wilds at bay, and perhaps find a roll of toilet paper along the way. 

## The Core Rules

Whenever a character tries to do something that could result in a failure, you determine whether it succeeds by rolling *below* the most relevant attribute on a *d20*: **Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS),** or **Charisma (CHA)**.

Here are some convenient mappings for common checks:

| Attribute             | Type of check                                                                                                                   |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strength          | Physical Force, Melee Attack                                                             |
| Dexterity             | Climbing, Coordination, Quick, Stealthy, Ranged Attack |
| Constitution     | Physical Resistance (Disease, Poison, Petrification, etc), Endurance, Survival |
| Wisdom  | Awareness, Careful, Insightful                         |
| Intelligence             | Clever, Recollection, Knowhow                         |
| Charisma             | Persuasive, Flashy, Seductive, Intimidating                     |
### Usage die

Any item that has a **Usage die** is considered consumable or limited use. When that item is used the next Turn its Usage die is rolled. If the roll is 1-2 then the Usage Die is downgraded to the next lower die in the following chain: d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4. When you roll a 1-2 on a d4 the item is spent and the character has no more of it left. The same thing goes for any **Ability Die**, **Radiation Die**, **Quality Die**, etc.

### Advantage & Disadvantage

The Game Master (GM) may decide that a particular course of action or task has a higher or lower chance of success. They will ask a player to roll an additional d20 when making a check - with **advantage** the lower result is used and with **disadvantage**, the higher.

### Distance
Rather than track precise numbers, **Goblins and Grappling Hooks” uses 4 abstract ranges for measuring distances. **Close**, **Nearby**, **Far-Away** and **Distant**. 

Here are approximates showing what that may mean in feet or meters.

|  CLOSE   |  NEARBY   |  FAR AWAY  |
|:--------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| 0 - 5ft  | 5 - 60ft  | 60 - 120ft |
| 0 - 1,5m | 1,5 - 20m |  20 - 40m  |

### Experience

Goblins and Grappling Hooks uses a milestone system for advancement. That is, the GM will decide when the appropriate time is for characters to advance.

### Gaining levels

When a character **levels** up, their maximum Hit Points increase by rolling the Hit Die for the class. A player should also roll a d20 for each Stat. If the result is higher - that Stat increases by 1. Some species have additional modifiers.

## Character Creation

### Choose a species

All creatures in the lands are descendent of civilizations. Choose one. Note that robots may decide to resemble one but are otherwise not bound by an appearance.

Dwarves: Generally between 4-5’ tall. 
Goblins: Generally between 3-4’ tall. 
Elves: Generally between 5-6’ tall though few grow taller
Gnomes: Generally between 3-4’ tall
Hobgoblins: Generally between 5-6’ tall though few grow taller
Human: Generally between 5-6’ tall though some grow taller.
Orcs. Generally between 6-7’ tall through some grow taller


### Choose a class

There are 5 classes to play as and choose from: **Humanoid**, **Mutant**, **Robot**, **Plantoid** and **Psionicist**. Your class determines your Hit Points and unique abilities. 

### Roll attributes

**Pure Strain Humanoids**
Pure Strain Humanoids are survivors of a number of different species. Through luck or genetics they have survived better than the common folk. They boast immunity to radiation, tend to be attractive, and gain a few other perks due to their heritage. Their height, weight and other attributes depend on their species.

#### Starting Attributes: 
Roll 4d6 and drop the lowest die for each attribute. Once the stats are generated they may all be swapped around freely.  Afterward, add 1 point to any attribute under 15 and 1 point to CHA (max 19).

**Level 0 HP:** d8
**HP Per Level/Resting:** 1d8
**Radiation die:** N/A (see below)

#### Special Features
Pure Strain Humanoids don't suffer mutations or radiation damage from any source during play. Additionally, there are some perks depending on species:

Dwarves: +1 to Strength, +1 to Constitution, -1 DEX
Goblins: +2 Dexterity,. -1 Wisdom
Elves: +2 Intelligence, -1 Wisdom
Gnomes: +1 Intelligence
Hobgoblins: +1 Strength, 2d6 extra starting slugs,
Human: Select apprenticeship, 1d6 extra slugs, roll INT checks with advantage
Orcs. +2 Strength, -2 Charisma, roll all CHA checks with advantage

#### Leveling up

Roll to see if attributes increase.


**Mutants**
Mutants vary wildly. Some have extra appendages others share forms or attributes with animals or plant life. Most mutants that adventure are between 3' and 7' tall with the average height being similar to their species.

#### Starting Attributes: 
Roll a single d20 for each stat. Reroll all results of 1 and 20.

**Level 0 HP:** d6
**HP Per Level/Resting:** 1d6
**Radiation die:** d10

#### Mutations

Mutants start the game with 1 randomly chosen **Mutations** and an **Ability Die** of d4. This die is refreshed after a long rest. To use a **Mutation**, first check the attributes that corresponds with what you are attempting to do, then roll the **Ability Die** to see if it decreases a step.
**Reactive Mutations (R)** can be triggered even when it isn't the targeted player's turn, and do not count as an action. If a roll of 20 is made while using a **Mutation**, the **Mutation** cannot be used again until the character finishes a long rest.

Gain a random **Psionic Power** on **even** levels, to a max of five. When gaining a sixth **Psionic Power**, that one replaces an old one.

**Robots**
Constructs from the war, robots vary quite a bit in composition.

#### Starting Attributes: 
Robots don't get to roll, but instead generate their attributes with a point-buy system. Their starting stats begin at 8, and they have 25 points to spend to increase them. Raising a stat above 13 costs 2 points, Above 14 costs 3 points, above 15 cost 4 points, and so on. Robots cannot raise a single stat above 18.

**Level 0 HP:** d10
**HP Per Level/Repair:** 1d10 (Robots use **Scrap** to perform self-repair instead of resting)
**Radiation die:** N/A (see below)


#### Modules

Robots start the game with two **Modules** of their choice and an **Ability Die** of d4. This die is renewed after running a thorough database diagnosis routine (rest). To use a **Module**, first test the attribute that corresponds with what you are attempting to do, then roll the **Ability Die** to check if it decreases a step. **Reactive Modules (R)** can be triggered even when it isn't the targeted player's turn, and does not count as an action.

then spend one **Scrap**+level to either increase the **Ability Die** one step or gain a **Module** of choice to a maximum of four. When gaining a fifth module, that one replaces an old one.

### Pick a background

Start the game with one randomly selected **Apprenticeship** that represents what the character did for a living before he or she started adventuring as well as starting equipment. Any tests made by a player that falls under that **Apprenticeship** have **Advantage** (GM's discretion). A character may spend a year as an apprentice before taking a job in that area. Daily pay (in slugs) as a full-time worker is noted in the table below along with the risk of pursuing that profession. After 5 years, the PC/NPC is considered an expert and may double the compensation per day listed.

#### Encumbrance

A character can carry a number of items equal to their STR with no issues. Carrying more than this amount means they are **encumbered** and all attribute tests are taken with **Disadvantage** - you can also only ever move to somewhere Nearby. A character simply cannot carry more than double their STR.

#### Equipment quality & degradation

Whenever weapons and armor is found or about to be bought, roll a **d8** on the table below to see what its **Quality Die** is. The GM will increase or decrease the cost of equipment by 5-25 Slugs, depending on its quality. When rolling an attack roll of **20** or when dealing **maximum damage** with a Melee Weapon, test the corresponding **Quality Die** to see if the weapon breaks. When rolling an attack roll of **20** with a Ranged Weapon, test the corresponding **Quality Die** to see if the weapon breaks. When an enemy rolls a **1** on an attack, test the corresponding **Quality Die** to see if the PC’s armor breaks. Equipment can be repaired by using **Scrap** and testing **INT**. A successful test increases the **Quality Die** by one step, to a maximum of D8. Whenever equipment is used in ways that could harm it, test the **Quality Die**.


| Result | Quality die |
|:------:|:-----------:|
|  1-3   |     d4      |
|  4-5   |     d6      |
|  6-7   |     d8      |
|   8    |     d10     |

### Armor Points

Armor provides protection by reducing all incoming damage and comes in 4 different kinds: **Light**, **Medium**, **Heavy** and **Tech**. Each Armor Point (AP) will reduce the amount of physical damage taken. The players are encouraged to describe the kind of armor the characters are wearing and what it's made of.



| Type         | AP | Desc.                                                          |
|:-------------|:---|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Light        | 2  | Thick denim, pre-war work clothes, animal hides.                |
| Medium       | 4  | Leather Jacket, Metal cans bolted together, Pieces of Plastic. |
| Heavy        | 6  | Riot Gear, Tires, Metal Sheets.                                |
| Tech         | *  | HAZMAT suit, Power Armor, Jet-Pack.                            |
| Small shield | 1  | Traffic Sign, Corrugated Metal.                                |
| Large shield | 2  | Car Door, Sewer Lid.                                           |

**Enemies** usually have 1 AP for every HD above 1. To figure this out quickly simply -1 from their HD. *For example: A 3 HD enemy has 2 AP.* Humanoid enemies can also carry shields. (All to a maximum of 10 AP)

\*\* Read more about Full Auto Fire below.



### Full auto fire

Fully automated guns, such as SMGs and machine guns give the player the option to use **Full Auto Fire**. First roll the quality die for the weapon and note its result - you can make that many attacks with this weapon in a row, until it jams and you have to stop shooting. Fixing a gun that is jammed when in combat takes a moment. Don't forget that **Full Auto Fire** uses one Slug per attack made.


## Combat

### Time & turns

There are 2 important types of tracked time: **Rounds** and **Turns**  **Rounds** are used during combat and fast paced scenes of danger and **Turns** are used when exploring and adventuring. A GM may advance the clock as needed should the adventure require it.

### Initiative

When combat breaks out, everyone must be sorted into an order so they each get to act and react in turn. Every character tests their **DEX**, those that succeed, take their turn before their opponents. They must then act as a group - deciding their own order for actions. Those that fail their **DEX** tests, go after their opponents.


### Player's turn
During a player's turn, a character may *attack*, make an average *move* and perform some other small *bonus action* like dropping or readying a weapon.

These actions are interchangeable from left to right, but not the other way. You can, for example, sacrifice your attack to make two moves and a small action, but you can't sacrifice a small action to get an extra attack. Some actions and abilities require a full round.

### Movement 

On their turn every character can move somewhere **Nearby** as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of the move. They can forgo their action and move somewhere **Far-Away** instead. Anything beyond **Far-Away** can be classified as **Distant** and would take 3 moves to get to.



### Attacking, defending & damage

## Attacking
When a character attacks a creature they must roll below its STR against a Melee Attack, DEX against a Ranged Attack, or a different attribute for an illusion or Psionic Attack. A GM will give the stat required for the check but see table below

To make a Melee Attack an opponent must be Close. Ranged Attacks against Close opponents are possible, but the attacker suffers a Disadvantage.

The damage an attack deals is based on the character’s class or the ability they used.



## Defending
When a creature attacks, to avoid taking damage or being affected, the character must roll below its STR against a Melee Attack, DEX against a Ranged Attack, or a different attribute for an illusion or Psionic Attack. A GM will give the stat required for the check.

To make a Melee Attack an opponent must be Close. Ranged Attacks against Close opponents are possible, but the attacker suffers a Disadvantage.

The damage an attack deals is based on the number of HD a monster has. Use the table below to determine the attack value of an enemy as well as the damage it deals. The GM may of course add special abilities and effects as they see fit.  HD represents an enemy's level and the number of d8 rolled to determine its HP.

| Monster HD |     Damage     |
|:----------:|:--------------:|
|     1      |     d4 (2)     |
|     2      |     d6 (3)     |
|     3      |    2d4 (4)     |
|     4      |    d10 (5)     |
|     5      |    d12 (6)     |
|     6      |  d6 + d8 (7)   |
|     7      |    2d8 (8)     |
|     8      |    3d6 (9)     |
|     9      |   2d10 (10)    |
|     10     | d10 + d12 (11) |


### Critical hits (Optional)

If a player rolls a 1 when making an attack roll, the attack counts as a **critical hit** which doubles the result of the damage dice they roll.  Don't forget to check the Weapon and Armor Quality Die.


### Converting saves

Goblins & Grappling Hooks ignores saves and instead asks the player to roll attribute **checks** when any environmental hazard, trap or potentially harmful effect would impact them - using the table below as a guide.

|                  STR                   |                 DEX                 |                 CON                  |
|:--------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| Physical Harm that *cannot* be dodged. | Physical Harm that *can* be dodged. | Poison, Disease, Radiation or Death. |

|        INT         |           WIS            |        CHA        |
|:------------------:|:------------------------:|:-----------------:|
| Psionic abilities. | Deception and Illusions. | Charming effects. |


### Death & dying

When a character is reduced to zero Hit Points (HP) they are incapacitated and cannot make any actions. When the fight is over and/or the characters are out of danger, an incapacitated character rolls a d8 on the table below to see what happens to them. If they survive they gain 1d4 HP immediately. Congratulations, that character is now no longer incapacitated!

*If the characters lose the fight or are unable to recover the body of a character, their character is lost forever!*

### Deadlier combat

If you want deadlier combat (and who doesn't), use this following rule:
When a character (PC or NPC) takes critical damage, roll on the Incapacitated table. A character that reaches 0 HP dies straight away.

| ROLL | RESULT                                                                                                                          |
|:---:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **KO'd** - Knocked out cold.                                                                                                       |
|  2  | **Bump on the Head** - Disadvantage on all tests for the next 1d4 minutes.                                                         |
|  3  | **Fractured Bones** - STR, DEX and CON are temp. -2 for the next 1d6 days.                                                         |
|  4  | **Cracked Skull** - INT and WIS are temp. -2 for the next 1d6 days.                                                                |
|  5  | **Crippled** - STR or DEX permanently reduced by 2.                                                                             |
|  6  | **Disfigured** - CHA is permanently reduced by 2. All CHA tests have Disadvantage, apart from CHA tests to threaten or intimidate. |
|  7  | **Limb loss** - Roll a d6 - 1. Hand, 2. Foot, 3. Arm, 4. Leg, 5. Face (Decrease CHA to 4), 6. Head (and you're probably dead).     |
|  8  | **Dead** - Spectacularly eviscerated, blown up, melted, smashed into jelly, etc.                                                   |

### Healing

Characters can regain lost Hit Points from Herbs, Drugs, Abilities and in the case of Robot characters, by being repaired. They can never gain more than their maximum - and can never go below zero.

### Resting

When characters rest for about an hour, it’s considered a “short rest” and they  regain the use of all their Armor points. Also once per day, after a 6 hour “long rest”, their Ability Die is completely refreshed and they may roll a Hit Die associated with their class and regain that many HP. There may be other benefits depending on items, abilities, or the character’s class.

## Drugs & addiction

All drugs take effect immediately after they have been used and last for **d6 blissful minutes**. When the effect wears off, you get Disadvantage to all INT and WIS tests for the **following hour**. If any one drug is used more than once per day, a CON test must be passed or the user becomes **addicted**. An addict must take one hit every 8 hours, or get disadvantage to all **INT**, **WIS** and **CHA** tests. Drugs are normally easy to come by, and the pricing depends entirely on the supply and demand, but normally cost between 20-50 Slugs/dose.

| NAME       | EFFECT                                                                             |
|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Brainz     | Advantage to all INT/WIS tests and against Psionic Attacks.                        |
| Speed      | Act first and get Advantage to all DEX tests.                                      |
| Sweet      | Advantage to all CHA tests.                                                        |
| Stimpack   | Instantly heals 2d6 damage.                                                        |
| Cleaner    | Induces terrible vomiting while curing all addiction. Pass CON test or lose d6 HP. |
| Rad-Off    | Refreshes Radiation Die by one step, up to its maximum.                            |
| Rad-Screen | Gain Advantage when rolling Radiation Die for 1 hour.                              |

## Radiation

When you approach a zone that is glowing from radiation, roll your **Radiation Die**.

Depending on how close you are to the source of the glow and the level of radiation, roll more or less often - **Low**, 1/day, **Moderate** 1/hour, **High** 1/minute, **Extreme** 1/moment. Reduce **CON** and **Max HP** by **2** for each step the radiation die has decreased from its original size. If you roll 1-2 on a radiation die the size of a d4, roll a d6 on the table below.

The radiation die never goes below d4, but a roll on 1-2 still counts as if it was reduced. Certain Tech and drugs mitigate the effects of radiation.

| RESULT | EFFECT                                                                 |
|:-------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | **Glowing** - 1-in-6 chance to gain a random mutation.                 |
| 2      | **Skin peel** - Disadvantage on all CHA tests for 1 day.               |
| 3      | **Headache** - Disadvantage on all INT tests for 1 day and d6 damage.  |
| 4      | **It stings!** - Take d8 damage.                                       |
| 5      | **It burns!** - Take d12 damage.                                       |
| 6      | **I'm melting!** - You melt into a glowing, horrible mess (and die).   |

## Poisons

Poisons come in many different forms and can cause a wide variety of effects on the victim. Most poisons will require a passed **CON** test to resist and/or neutralize. See table below for examples of poisons:

| TYPE           | EFFECT                                              |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| Venom          | Victim takes d6 damage every Minute.                |
| Hallucinogenic | Victim hallucinates for 1 hour.                     |
| Sleep          | Victim is knocked out for 8 hours. Can be awakened. |
| Paralyzing     | Lose ability to move.                               |

## Controlling robots

Humans can attempt to give a nearby robot an order as an action. They must successfully test their **CHA** for each robot they are attempting to control, adding the Robots' **HD** to the roll. The GM can also give further modifications, Advantage/Disadvantage to the roll depending on the complexity of the order. Robots that are Controlled by Humans must spend all their actions and movement to obey the command of the Human for 2d4

Moments after being Controlled. After that, their software reboots and they go back to their original command. Robots will normally not obey orders to attack another human being.

| ORDER                       | MODIFICATION |
|:----------------------------|:------------:|
|  Give information about...  |      -       |
|  Protect...                 |      +1      |
|  Unlock/Lock...             |      +2      |
|   Attack...                  |      +3      |
|   Shut down...               |      +4      |

## Random encounters

The GM may roll a d4 every 15 minutes of real world play, or whenever it makes sense in the fiction (when the player characters are being loud). A result of 1-2 means the players will encounter a randomly generated creature or distraction in the following Turn.

## Creature reactions

Some creatures and NPCs will have predetermined personalities and goals that will guide a GM when choosing their actions and feelings towards the characters. Those that do not, such as randomly encountered creatures, make a d8 Reaction roll on the following table:

| RESULT | REACTION                     |
|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| 1      | Flee then roll again.        |
| 2      | Avoid the PCs entirely.      |
| 3      | Trade with PCs.              |
| 4      | Give the PCs aid.            |
| 5      | Mistake the PCs for friends. |
| 6      | Trick the PCs (roll again).  |
| 7      | Call for Reinforcements.     |
| 8      | Capture/Kill/Eat the PCs.    |

## Tech

Tech is a collective term for highly advanced, pre-apocalypse equipment that give its owner a variety of beneficial effects and abilities. **Tech Weapons** might add +2 to any attribute being tested while using it, ignore armor, sets enemies on fire, etc. **Tech Armor** can double the amount of AP the armor type would normally have, protect its user from radiation, refresh spent AP after every combat, or other beneficial effects. Most (if not all) Tech rely on a steady supply of **Energy Packs**, a rare and expensive power supply. An Energy Pack has a d6 Usage Die, but more powerful variations are rumored to exist.

Without these, most tech items simply will not work. When creating your own Tech, try to make the items unique from each other. They are supposed to be powerful, one-of-a-kind equipment that give its owner an edge.

When rolling to see the **Quality** of Tech, roll a d6 instead of the normal d8.

## Understanding tech

To effectively use Tech, you must first understand how it works. Normally it is enough that the player describes how her character experiments with the Tech, but some highly advanced Tech requires a successful INT test to fully understand and make use of. Such a roll is often made with Disadvantage.

| EXAMPLE       | NAME                 | EFFECT                                                                                                                  |

## Vehicles & driving

Everyone can drive a **Vehicle**, but it takes skill and a successful **DEX** check to pull off a crazy or daring maneuver behind the wheel. Vehicles have Hit Points and Armor Points.

These can only be repaired if **Scrap** is used and an INT test is passed. Attack rolls made while in a moving vehicle have Disadvantage, while Defence Rolls have Advantage. When a vehicle reaches 0 Hit Points, roll a d6 on the table on the opposite page.
