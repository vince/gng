# Welcome to the Apocalypse

Even magic, they say, has rules that should not be broken. Yet, in a mystical land, a wizard with an unlimited thirst for power, crossed the threshold that Gods themselves had not dared by casting an impossible *10th level spell*. It shattered the dimensions. Entire settlements of humans from faraway lands, with vast powers of “technology”, crashed through the portals with cars, computers, guns, and fatty, processed, packaged foods.

War erupted. When the dust settled, magic, machinery, and everything in between lay muddled. Great cities were laid to waste. A century later, the few that survive do what they can to find food, shelter, and rebuild the remains of civilization.

**Goblins & Grappling Hooks** is a traditional tabletop roleplaying game, set in an atomic wasteland where humanoids, machines, and awakened plants roam an irradiated planet trying to survive, keep the wilds at bay, and perhaps find a roll of toilet paper along the way.

# The Core Rules

Whenever a character tries to do something that could result in a failure, you determine whether it succeeds by rolling *below* the most relevant attribute on a *d20*: **Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS),** or **Charisma (CHA)**.

Here are some convenient mappings for common checks:

| Attribute             | Type of check                                                                                                                   |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strength          | Physical Force, Melee Attack                                                             |
| Dexterity             | Climbing, Coordination, Quick, Stealthy, Ranged Attack |
| Constitution     | Physical Resistance (Disease, Poison, Petrification, etc), Endurance, Survival |
| Wisdom  | Awareness, Careful, Insightful                         |
| Intelligence             | Clever, Recollection, Knowhow                         |
| Charisma             | Persuasive, Flashy, Seductive, Intimidating                     |

## Usage die

Any item that has a **Usage die** is considered consumable or limited use. When that item is used the next turn its Usage Die is rolled. If the roll is 1-2 then the Usage Die is downgraded to the next lower die in the following chain: d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4. When you roll a 1-2 on a d4 the item is spent and the character has no more of it left. The same thing goes for any **Ability Die**, **Radiation Die**, **Quality Die**, etc.

## Advantage & Disadvantage

The Game Master (GM) may decide that a particular course of action or task has a higher or lower chance of success. They will ask a player to roll an additional d20 when making a check - with **advantage** the lower result is used and with **disadvantage**, the higher.

## Distance
Rather than track precise numbers, **Goblins and Grappling Hooks” uses 4 abstract ranges for measuring distances. **Close**, **Nearby**, **Far-Away** and **Distant**.

Here are approximates showing what that may mean in feet or meters. Distant is anything beyond Far Away.

|  CLOSE   |  NEARBY   |  FAR AWAY  |
|:--------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| 0 - 5ft  | 5 - 60ft  | 60 - 120ft |
| 0 - 1,5m | 1,5 - 20m |  20 - 40m  |

## Experience

Goblins and Grappling Hooks uses a milestone system for advancement. That is, the GM will decide when the appropriate time is for characters to advance.

### Gaining levels

When a character **levels** up, their maximum Hit Points increase by rolling the Hit Die for the class. A player should also roll a d20 for each Stat. If the result is higher - that Stat increases by 1.

# Character Creation

Creating a character involves 4 steps

1. Choose a species
2. Choose a class, roll attributes, and pick special features
3. Choose an apprenticeship
4. Buy equipment (start with 1d4 slugs unless otherwise noted)


## Choose a species

All creatures in the lands are descendent of civilizations. Choose one.

| Species             | Description                                                                                                                   |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dwarves          | Generally between 4-5’ tall.                                                   |
| Goblins             | Generally between 3-4’ tall. |
| Elves     | Generally between 5-6’ tall though few grow taller |
| Gnomes  | Generally between 3-4’ tall                         |
| Hobgoblins             | Generally between 5-6’ tall though few grow taller                        |
| Human             | Generally between 5-6’ tall though some grow taller                     |
| Orcs             | Generally between 6-7’ tall through some grow taller                     |
| Mutant, Plantoids, Robots            | Varies wildly. Be creative!                      |


## Choose a class

There are 5 classes to play as and choose from: **Humanoid**, **Mutant**, **Robot**, **Plantoid** and **Psionicist**. Your class determines your Hit Points and unique abilities.

### Pure Strain Humanoids
Pure Strain Humanoids are survivors of a number of different species. Through luck or genetics they have survived better than the common folk. They boast immunity to radiation, tend to be attractive, and gain a few other perks due to their heritage. Their height, weight and other attributes depend on their species.

#### Starting Attributes:
Roll 4d6 and drop the lowest die for each attribute. Once the stats are generated they may all be swapped around freely.  Afterward, add 1 point to any attribute under 15 and 1 point to CHA (max 19).

**Level 0 HP:** d8
**HP Per Level/Resting:** 1d8
**Radiation die:** N/A (see below)

#### Special Features
Pure Strain Humanoids don't suffer mutations or radiation damage from any source during play. They may also select their apprenticeship and start with an additional 1d6 slugs.

#### Leveling up

Roll to see if attributes increase.


### Mutants
Mutants vary wildly. Some have extra appendages others share forms or attributes with animals or plant life. Most mutants that adventure are between 3' and 7' tall with the average height being similar to their species.

#### Starting Attributes:
Roll a single d20 for each stat. Reroll all results of 1 and 20.

**Level 0 HP:** d6
**HP Per Level/Resting:** 1d6
**Radiation die:** d10

#### Powers (Mutations)

Mutants start the game with 1 randomly chosen **Mutations** and an **Ability Die** of d4. This die is refreshed after a long rest. To use a **Mutation**, first check the attributes that corresponds with what you are attempting to do, then roll the **Ability Die** to see if it decreases a step.
**Reactive Mutations (R)** can be triggered even when it isn't the targeted player's turn, and do not count as an action. If a roll of 20 is made while using a **Mutation**, the **Mutation** cannot be used again until the character finishes a long rest.

| Mutations             | Effect                                                                                                                   |

### Robots
Constructs from the war, robots vary quite a bit in composition.

#### Starting Attributes:
Robots don't get to roll, but instead generate their attributes with a point-buy system. Their starting stats begin at 8, and they have 25 points to spend to increase them. Raising a stat above 13 costs 2 points, Above 14 costs 3 points, above 15 cost 4 points, and so on. Robots cannot raise a single stat above 18.

**Level 0 HP:** d10
**HP Per Level/Repair:** 1d10 (Robots use **Scrap** to perform self-repair instead of resting)
**Radiation die:** N/A (see below)


#### Powers (Modules)

Robots start the game with two **Modules** of their choice and an **Ability Die** of d4. This die is renewed after running a thorough database diagnosis routine (rest). To use a **Module**, first check the attribute that corresponds with what you are attempting to do, then roll the **Ability Die** to check if it decreases a step. **Reactive Modules (R)** can be triggered even when it isn't the targeted player's turn, and does not count as an action.

## Pick an Apprenticeship

Start the game with one randomly selected **Apprenticeship** that represents what the character did for a living before he or she started adventuring as well as starting equipment. Any checks made by a player that falls under that **Apprenticeship** have **Advantage** (GM's discretion). A character may spend a year as an apprentice before taking a job in that area. Daily pay (in slugs) as a full-time worker is noted in the table below along with the risk of pursuing that profession. After 5 years, the PC/NPC is considered an expert and may double the compensation per day listed.

#### Encumbrance

A character can carry a number of items equal to their STR with no issues. Carrying more than this amount means they are **encumbered** and all attribute checks are taken with **Disadvantage** - you can also only ever move to somewhere Nearby. A character simply cannot carry more than double their STR.

#### Equipment quality & degradation

Whenever weapons and armor is found or about to be bought, roll a **d8** on the table below to see what its **Quality Die** is. The GM will increase or decrease the cost of equipment by 5-25 Slugs, depending on its quality. When rolling an attack roll of **20** or when dealing **maximum damage** with a Melee Weapon, check the corresponding **Quality Die** to see if the weapon breaks. When rolling an attack roll of **20** with a Ranged Weapon, check the corresponding **Quality Die** to see if the weapon breaks. When an enemy rolls a **1** on an attack, check the corresponding **Quality Die** to see if the PC’s armor breaks. Equipment can be repaired by using **Scrap** and checking **INT**. A successful check increases the **Quality Die** by one step, to a maximum of D8. Whenever equipment is used in ways that could harm it, check the **Quality Die**.


| Result | Quality die |
|:------:|:-----------:|
|  1-3   |     d4      |
|  4-5   |     d6      |
|  6-7   |     d8      |
|   8    |     d10     |

### Armor Points

Armor provides protection by reducing all incoming damage and comes in 4 different kinds: **Light**, **Medium**, **Heavy** and **Tech**. Each Armor Point (AP) will reduce the amount of physical damage taken. The players are encouraged to describe the kind of armor the characters are wearing and what it's made of.



| Type         | AP | Desc.                                                          |
|:-------------|:---|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Light        | 2  | Thick denim, pre-war work clothes, animal hides.                |
| Medium       | 4  | Leather Jacket, Metal cans bolted together, Pieces of Plastic. |
| Heavy        | 6  | Riot Gear, Tires, Metal Sheets.                                |
| Tech         | *  | HAZMAT suit, Power Armor, Jet-Pack.                            |
| Small shield | 1  | Traffic Sign, Corrugated Metal.                                |
| Large shield | 2  | Car Door, Sewer Lid.                                           |

**Enemies** usually have 1 AP for every HD above 1. To figure this out quickly simply -1 from their HD. *For example: A 3 HD enemy has 2 AP.* Humanoid enemies can also carry shields. (All to a maximum of 10 AP)

\*\* Read more about Full Auto Fire below.



### Full auto fire

Fully automated guns, such as SMGs and machine guns give the player the option to use **Full Auto Fire**. First roll the quality die for the weapon and note its result - you can make that many attacks with this weapon in a row, until it jams and you have to stop shooting. Fixing a gun that is jammed when in combat takes an action. Don't forget that **Full Auto Fire** uses one Slug per attack made.


## Combat

### Time & turns

There are 2 important types of tracked time: **Rounds** and **Turns**  **Rounds** are used during combat and fast paced scenes of danger and **Turns** are used when exploring and adventuring. A GM may advance the clock as needed should the adventure require it.

### Initiative

When combat breaks out, everyone must be sorted into an order so they each get to act and react in turn. Every character checks their **DEX**, those that succeed, take their turn before their opponents. They must then act as a group - deciding their own order for actions. Those that fail their **DEX** checks, go after their opponents.


### Player's turn
During a player's turn, a character may *attack*, make an average *move* and perform some other small *bonus action* like dropping or readying a weapon.

These actions are interchangeable from left to right, but not the other way. You can, for example, sacrifice your attack to make two moves and a small action, but you can't sacrifice a small action to get an extra attack. Some actions and abilities require a full round.

### Movement 

On their turn every character can move somewhere **Nearby** as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of the move. They can forgo their action and move somewhere **Far-Away** instead. Anything beyond **Far-Away** can be classified as **Distant** and would take 3 moves to get to.



### Attacking, defending & damage

## Attacking
When a character attacks a creature they must roll below its STR against a Melee Attack, DEX against a Ranged Attack, or a different attribute for an illusion or Psionic Attack. A GM will give the stat required for the check but see table below

To make a Melee Attack an opponent must be Close. Ranged Attacks against Close opponents are possible, but the attacker suffers a Disadvantage.

The damage an attack deals is based on the character’s class or the ability they used.



## Defending
When a creature attacks, to avoid taking damage or being affected, the character must roll below its STR against a Melee Attack, DEX against a Ranged Attack, or a different attribute for an illusion or Psionic Attack. A GM will give the stat required for the check.

To make a Melee Attack an opponent must be Close. Ranged Attacks against Close opponents are possible, but the attacker suffers a Disadvantage.

The damage an attack deals is based on the number of HD a monster has. Use the table below to determine the attack value of an enemy as well as the damage it deals. The GM may of course add special abilities and effects as they see fit.  HD represents an enemy's level and the number of d8 rolled to determine its HP.

| Monster HD |     Damage     |
|:----------:|:--------------:|
|     1      |     d4 (2)     |
|     2      |     d6 (3)     |
|     3      |    2d4 (4)     |
|     4      |    d10 (5)     |
|     5      |    d12 (6)     |
|     6      |  d6 + d8 (7)   |
|     7      |    2d8 (8)     |
|     8      |    3d6 (9)     |
|     9      |   2d10 (10)    |
|     10     | d10 + d12 (11) |


### Critical hits (Optional)

If a player rolls a 1 when making an attack roll, the attack counts as a **critical hit** which doubles the result of the damage dice they roll.  Don't forget to check the Weapon and Armor Quality Die.


### Converting saves

Goblins & Grappling Hooks ignores saves and instead asks the player to roll attribute **checks** when any environmental hazard, trap or potentially harmful effect would impact them - using the table below as a guide.


|                  STR                   |                 DEX                 |                 CON                  |
|:--------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| Physical Harm that *cannot* be dodged. | Physical Harm that *can* be dodged. | Poison, Disease, Radiation or Death. |

|        INT         |           WIS            |        CHA        |
|:------------------:|:------------------------:|:-----------------:|
| Psionic abilities. | Deception and Illusions. | Charming effects. |


### Death & dying

When a character is reduced to zero Hit Points (HP) they are incapacitated and cannot make any actions. When the fight is over and/or the characters are out of danger, an incapacitated character rolls a d8 on the table below to see what happens to them. If they survive they gain 1d4 HP immediately. Congratulations, that character is now no longer incapacitated!

*If the characters lose the fight or are unable to recover the body of a character, their character is lost forever!*


### Healing

Characters can regain lost Hit Points from Herbs, Drugs, Powers and in the case of Robot characters, by being repaired. They can never gain more than their maximum - and can never go below zero.

### Resting

When characters rest for about an hour, it’s considered a “short rest” and they  regain the use of all their Armor points. Also once per day, after a 6 hour “long rest”, their Ability Die is completely refreshed and they may roll a Hit Die associated with their class and regain that many HP. There may be other benefits depending on items, abilities, or the character’s class.
