## Deadlier combat

If you want deadlier combat (and who doesn't), use this following rule:
When a character (PC or NPC) takes critical damage, roll on the Incapacitated table. A character that reaches 0 HP dies straight away.

| ROLL | RESULT                                                                                                                          |
|:---:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **KO'd** - Knocked out cold.                                                                                                       |
|  2  | **Bump on the Head** - Disadvantage on all checks for the next 1d4 minutes.                                                         |
|  3  | **Fractured Bones** - STR, DEX and CON are temp. -2 for the next 1d6 days.                                                         |
|  4  | **Cracked Skull** - INT and WIS are temp. -2 for the next 1d6 days.                                                                |
|  5  | **Crippled** - STR or DEX permanently reduced by 2.                                                                             |
|  6  | **Disfigured** - CHA is permanently reduced by 2. All CHA checks have Disadvantage, apart from CHA checks to threaten or intimidate. |
|  7  | **Limb loss** - Roll a d6 - 1. Hand, 2. Foot, 3. Arm, 4. Leg, 5. Face (Decrease CHA to 4), 6. Head (and you're probably dead).     |
|  8  | **Dead** - Spectacularly eviscerated, blown up, melted, smashed into jelly, etc.                                                   |

## Drugs & addiction

All drugs take effect immediately after they have been used and last for **d6 blissful minutes**. When the effect wears off, you get Disadvantage to all INT and WIS checks for the **following hour**. If any one drug is used more than once per day, a CON check must be passed or the user becomes **addicted**. An addict must take one hit every 8 hours, or get disadvantage to all **INT**, **WIS** and **CHA** checks. Drugs are normally easy to come by, and the pricing depends entirely on the supply and demand, but normally cost between 20-50 Slugs/dose.

| NAME       | EFFECT                                                                             |
|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Brainz     | Advantage to all INT/WIS checks and against Psionic Attacks.                        |
| Speed      | Act first and get Advantage to all DEX checks.                                      |
| Sweet      | Advantage to all CHA checks.                                                        |
| Stimpack   | Instantly heals 2d6 damage.                                                        |
| Cleaner    | Induces terrible vomiting while curing all addiction. Pass CON check or lose d6 HP. |
| Rad-Off    | Refreshes Radiation Die by one step, up to its maximum.                            |
| Rad-Screen | Gain Advantage when rolling Radiation Die for 1 hour.                              |

## Radiation

When you approach a zone that is glowing from radiation, roll your **Radiation Die**.

Depending on how close you are to the source of the glow and the level of radiation, roll more or less often - **Low**, 1/day, **Moderate** 1/hour, **High** 1/minute, **Extreme** 1/moment. Reduce **CON** and **Max HP** by **2** for each step the radiation die has decreased from its original size. If you roll 1-2 on a radiation die the size of a d4, roll a d6 on the table below.

The radiation die never goes below d4, but a roll on 1-2 still counts as if it was reduced. Certain Tech and drugs mitigate the effects of radiation.

| RESULT | EFFECT                                                                 |
|:-------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | **Glowing** - 1-in-6 chance to gain a random mutation.                 |
| 2      | **Skin peel** - Disadvantage on all CHA checks for 1 day.               |
| 3      | **Headache** - Disadvantage on all INT checks for 1 day and d6 damage.  |
| 4      | **It stings!** - Take d8 damage.                                       |
| 5      | **It burns!** - Take d12 damage.                                       |
| 6      | **I'm melting!** - You melt into a glowing, horrible mess (and die).   |

## Poisons

Poisons come in many different forms and can cause a wide variety of effects on the victim. Most poisons will require a passed **CON** check to resist and/or neutralize. See table below for examples of poisons:

| TYPE           | EFFECT                                              |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| Venom          | Victim takes d6 damage every Minute.                |
| Hallucinogenic | Victim hallucinates for 1 hour.                     |
| Sleep          | Victim is knocked out for 8 hours. Can be awakened. |
| Paralyzing     | Lose ability to move.                               |

## Controlling robots

Humans can attempt to give a nearby robot an order as an action. They must successfully check their **CHA** for each robot they are attempting to control, adding the Robots' **HD** to the roll. The GM can also give further modifications, Advantage/Disadvantage to the roll depending on the complexity of the order. Robots that are Controlled by Humans must spend all their actions and movement to obey the command of the Human for 2d4

Moments after being Controlled. After that, their software reboots and they go back to their original command. Robots will normally not obey orders to attack another human being.

| ORDER                       | MODIFICATION |
|:----------------------------|:------------:|
|  Give information about...  |      -       |
|  Protect...                 |      +1      |
|  Unlock/Lock...             |      +2      |
|   Attack...                  |      +3      |
|   Shut down...               |      +4      |

## Random encounters

The GM may roll a d4 every 15 minutes of real world play, or whenever it makes sense in the fiction (when the player characters are being loud). A result of 1-2 means the players will encounter a randomly generated creature or distraction in the following Turn.

## Creature reactions

Some creatures and NPCs will have predetermined personalities and goals that will guide a GM when choosing their actions and feelings towards the characters. Those that do not, such as randomly encountered creatures, make a d8 Reaction roll on the following table:

| RESULT | REACTION                     |
|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| 1      | Flee then roll again.        |
| 2      | Avoid the PCs entirely.      |
| 3      | Trade with PCs.              |
| 4      | Give the PCs aid.            |
| 5      | Mistake the PCs for friends. |
| 6      | Trick the PCs (roll again).  |
| 7      | Call for Reinforcements.     |
| 8      | Capture/Kill/Eat the PCs.    |

## Tech

Tech is a collective term for highly advanced, pre-apocalypse equipment that give its owner a variety of beneficial effects and abilities. **Tech Weapons** might add +2 to any attribute being checked while using it, ignore armor, sets enemies on fire, etc. **Tech Armor** can double the amount of AP the armor type would normally have, protect its user from radiation, refresh spent AP after every combat, or other beneficial effects. Most (if not all) Tech rely on a steady supply of **Energy Packs**, a rare and expensive power supply. An Energy Pack has a d6 Usage Die, but more powerful variations are rumored to exist.

Without these, most tech items simply will not work. When creating your own Tech, try to make the items unique from each other. They are supposed to be powerful, one-of-a-kind equipment that give its owner an edge.

When rolling to see the **Quality** of Tech, roll a d6 instead of the normal d8.

## Understanding tech

To effectively use Tech, you must first understand how it works. Normally it is enough that the player describes how her character experiments with the Tech, but some highly advanced Tech requires a successful INT check to fully understand and make use of. Such a roll is often made with Disadvantage.

## Vehicles & driving

Everyone can drive a **Vehicle**, but it takes skill and a successful **DEX** check to pull off a crazy or daring maneuver behind the wheel. Vehicles have Hit Points and Armor Points.

These can only be repaired if **Scrap** is used and an INT check is passed. Attack rolls made while in a moving vehicle have Disadvantage, while Defence Rolls have Advantage. When a vehicle reaches 0 Hit Points, roll a d6 on the table on the opposite page.
