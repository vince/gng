# Welcome to the Apocalypse

Even magic, they say, has rules that should not be broken. Yet, in a mystical land, a wizard with an unlimited thirst for power, crossed the threshold that Gods themselves had not dared by casting an impossible *10th level spell*. It shattered the dimensions. Entire settlements of humans from faraway lands, with vast powers of “technology”, crashed through the portals with cars, computers, guns, and fatty, processed, packaged foods.

War erupted. When the dust settled, magic, machinery, and everything in between lay muddled. Great cities were laid to waste. A century later, the few that survive do what they can to find food, shelter, and rebuild the remains of civilization.

**Goblins & Grappling Hooks** is a traditional tabletop roleplaying game, set in an atomic wasteland where humanoids, machines, and awakened plants roam an irradiated planet trying to survive, keep the wilds at bay, and perhaps find a roll of toilet paper along the way.
